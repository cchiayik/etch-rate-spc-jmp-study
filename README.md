## 🎯 Project Objective

This case study applies **Statistical Process Control (SPC)** methods to analyze process stability in a semiconductor etching operation. Using historical data from multiple etch lines, the analysis uncovers **special cause variation**, evaluates **process capability**, and suggests **corrective actions**.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- ⚠️ All lines (B, C, D) failed stability tests due to **special cause variation**  
- 📉 Mean etch rates were consistently **below the 620 Å/min target**
- 📈 **Etch Line C** showed temporary improvement post-recalibration  
- ❌ **Process Capability Study = Not feasible** due to unstable variation  
- ✅ **Recommendations**: Real-time SPC, root cause analysis, Gage R&R, and follow-up DOE

## 🧭 How to Explore

1. **Excel** – open `Etch_Rate_Data.xlsx` to inspect raw and grouped values  
2. **JMP** – open `Etch_Rate_Analysis.jmp` (v16+) for:
   - Histograms / Boxplots for each line
   - Control Charts (X-bar & S)
   - Distribution & t-tests (CI + significance checks)

> 📝 *Ensure `.xlsx` file is in the same directory for linked data*
